# Kondo Spectroscopy Analysis

This repository contains part of the analysis code and supporting materials for the study of the Kondo effect in a standing NTCDA molecule, as used in my Masterthesis. The analysis is based on scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements and includes both experimental data processing and theoretical model fitting.

## Overview

This project includes:
- **Data Analysis Notebooks & Scripts:** Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that process spectroscopy data, perform curve fitting using the Frota function and to thus extract the Kondo Temperature by fitting the width evolution to theoretical models.
- **Master's Thesis:** The Master's thesis document titled *"Kondo Effect in a Standing Molecule"* by Valentin Maissen, which details the experimental setup, methods, and results (partially using the spectroscopic analysis done above).
- **Supporting Files:** Additional resources such as experimental data, custom style files, configuration scripts, and helper functions.
